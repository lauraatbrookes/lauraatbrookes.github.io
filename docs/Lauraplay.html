			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Enter Antonio, Salerio, and Solanio</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In sooth, I know not why I am so sad</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">It wearies me; you say it wearies you </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What stuff ‘tis made of, whereof it is born,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I am to learn;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And such a want-wit sadness makes of me</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That I have much ado to know myself</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">There where your argosies, with portly sail-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Or as it were the pageants of the sea-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As they fly by them with their woven wings</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Solanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The better part of my affections would</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And every object that might make me fear</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Would make me sad</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My wind, cooling my broth,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Would blow me to an ague when I thought</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What harm a wind too great might do at sea</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I should not see the sandy hour-glass run</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But I should think of shallows and of flats,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Vailing her high top lower than her ribs</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And see the holy edifice of stone,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Would scatter all her spices on the stream </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And, in a word, but even now worth this,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad?</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But tell not me; I know Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Is sad to think upon his merchandise</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Upon the fortune of this present year;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Solanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why then you are in love</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Fie, fie!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Solanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Because you are not merry; and ‘twere as easy</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time:</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And other of such vinegar aspect</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano</h2>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">We leave you now with better company</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I would have stay’d till I had made you merry,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">If worthier friends had not prevented me</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Your worth is very dear in my regard</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I take it your own business calls on you,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And you embrace th’ occasion to depart</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Good morrow, my good lords</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You grow exceeding strange; must it be so?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Exeunt Salerio and Solanio</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">We two will leave you; but at dinner-time</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I pray you, have in mind where we must meet</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I will not fail you</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Gratiano</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You look not well, Signior Antonio;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You have too much respect upon the world;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">They lose it that do buy it with much care</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Believe me, you are marvellously chang’d</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A stage, where every man must play a part,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And mine a sad one</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Gratiano</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Let me play the fool</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And let my liver rather heat with wine</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Than my heart cool with mortifying groans</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why should a man whose blood is warm within</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I love thee, and ‘tis my love that speaks-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">There are a sort of men whose visage </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And do a wilful stillness entertain,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As who should say ‘I am Sir Oracle,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.’</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O my Antonio, I do know of these</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That therefore only are reputed wise</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">If they should speak, would almost damn those ears</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I’ll tell thee more of this another time</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But fish not with this melancholy bait</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For this fool gudgeon, this opinion</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I’ll end my exhortation after dinner</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For Gratiano never lets me speak</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Gratiano</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Well, keep me company but two years moe,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Fare you well; I’ll grow a talker for this gear</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Gratiano</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Is that anything now?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,</p>
            <p class="prose" lang="en-GB">more than any man in all Venice. His reasons</p>
            <p class="prose" lang="en-GB">are as two grains of wheat hid in, two bushels of chaff:</p>
            <p class="prose" lang="en-GB">you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when</p>
            <p class="prose" lang="en-GB">you have them they are not worth the search</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Well; tell me now what lady is the same</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That you to-day promis’d to tell me of?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">‘Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How much I have disabled mine estat</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">By something showing a more swelling port</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Than my faint means would grant continuance </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">From such a noble rate; but my chief care</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Is to come fairly off from the great debts</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Wherein my time, something too prodigal,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I owe the most, in money and in love;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And from your love I have a warranty</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To unburden all my plots and purposes</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How to get clear of all the debts I owe</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Within the eye of honour, be assur’d</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My purse, my person, my extremest means,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Lie all unlock’d to your occasions</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The self-same way, with more advised watch,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To find the other forth; and by adventuring both</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Because what follows is pure innocence</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That which I owe is lost; but if you please</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To shoot another arrow that self way</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As I will watch the aim, or to find both,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Or bring your latter hazard back again </p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And thankfully rest debtor for the first</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Antonio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You know me well, and herein spend but time</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To wind about my love with circumstance;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In making question of my uttermost</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Than if you had made waste of all I have</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Then do but say to me what I should do</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That in your knowledge may by me be done,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In Belmont is a lady richly left,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And she is fair and, fairer than that word,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I did receive fair speechless messages</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu’d</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For the four winds blow in from every coast</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,</p>

			<h2 class="location" lang="en-GB">Belmont. Portia’s house</h2>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Enter Portia with her waiting-woman, Nerissa</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Good sentences, and well pronounc’d</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">They would be better, if well followed</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word ‘choose’! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead- whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will describe them; and according to my description, level at my affection</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">First, there is the Neapolitan prince</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear’d my lady his mother play’d false with a smith</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Then is there the County Palatine</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say ‘An you will not have me, choose.’ He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he- why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man. If a throstle sing he falls straight a-cap’ring; he will fence with his own shadow; if I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man’s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal’d under for another</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk. When he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept him</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords; they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition, depending on the caskets</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant them a fair departure</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he call’d</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Nerissa</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon, was the best deserving a fair lady</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Enter a Servingman</h2>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">How now! What news?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Servingman</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here to-night</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Portia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach; if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at thedoor</p>

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Antonio shall become bound- well</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Your answer to that</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Antonio is a good man</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient; yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England- and other ventures he hath, squand’red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves- I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats- I think I may take his bond</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Be assur’d you may</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If it please you to dine with us</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into! I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</p>

The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me ‘Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot’ or ‘good Gobbo’ or  good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.’ My conscience says ‘No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed, honest Gobbo’ or, as aforesaid, ‘honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run; scorn running with thy heels.’ Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. ‘Via!’ says the fiend; ‘away!’ says the fiend. ‘For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind’ says the fiend ‘and run.’ Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me ‘My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son’ or rather ‘an honest woman’s son’; for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste- well, my conscience says ‘Launcelot, budge not.’ ‘Budge,’ says the fiend. ‘Budge not,’ says my conscience. ‘Conscience,’ say I, (you counsel well.’ ‘Fiend,’ say I, ‘you counsel well.’ To be rul’d by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment; I will run</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing; truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man’s son may, but in the end truth will out</p>

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master’s a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am famish’d in his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune! Here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that was us’d to come so smug upon the mart. Let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh. What’s that good for?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million; laugh’d at my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes?</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? </p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the instruction</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Tubal </p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were hears’d at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? Why, so- and I know not what’s spent in the search. Why, thou- loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my shoulders; no sighs but o’ my breathing; no tears but o’ my shedding!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Tubal </p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in Genoa- </p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Tubal</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Tubal</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news- ha, ha!- heard in Genoa</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Tubal</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Thou stick’st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Tubal</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I am very glad of it; I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him; I am glad of it</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Tubal</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Tubal</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">But Antonio is certainly undone</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Nay, that’s true; that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I pray you tarry; pause a day or two</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I would detain you here some month or two</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Let music sound while he doth make his choice;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Fading in music. That the comparison</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win;</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As are those dulcet sounds in break of day</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">There is no vice so simple but assumes</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Some mark of virtue on his outward parts</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Who, inward search’d, have livers white as milk!</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And these assume but valour’s excrement</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And you shall see ‘tis purchas’d by the weight,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Which therein works a miracle in nature,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Making them lightest that wear most of it;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">So are those crisped snaky golden locks</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Which make such wanton gambols with the wind</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Upon supposed fairness often known</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To be the dowry of a second head-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The skull that bred them in the sepulchre</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The seeming truth which cunning times put on</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">When I did first impart my love to you,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I freely told you all the wealth I had</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How much I was a braggart. When I told you</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My state was nothing, I should then have told you</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That I was worse than nothing; for indeed</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I have engag’d myself to a dear friend,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The paper as the body of my friend,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And every word in it a gaping wound</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Salerio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Not one, my lord</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The present money to discharge the Jew,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">He would not take it. Never did I know</p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Enter Launcelot and Jessica</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter; therefore be o’ good cheer, for truly I think you are damn’d. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope, neither</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Jessica</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">And what hope is that, I pray thee?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not- that you are not the Jew’s daughter</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Jessica</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Truly then I fear you are damn’d both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fallw into Charybdis, your mother; well, you are gone both ways</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Jessica</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I shall be sav’d by my husband; he hath made me a Christian</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow before, e’en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Enter Lorenzo</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Jessica</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I’ll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he comes</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Jessica</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are out; he tells me flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew’s daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro’s belly; the Moor is with child by you, Launcelot</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">That is done, sir; they have all stomachs</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo </p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That is done too, sir, only ‘cover’ is the word</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Will you cover, then, sir?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Launcelot</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">For the table, sir, it shall be serv’d in; for the meat, sir, it shall be cover’d; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Exit</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Lorenzo</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O dear discretion, how his words are suited!</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The fool hath planted in his memory</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">An army of good words; and I do know</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A many fools that stand in better place,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Garnish’d like him, that for a tricksy word</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Jessica</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Past all expressing. It is very meet</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For, having such a blessing in his lady,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And if on earth he do not merit it,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In reason he should never come to heaven</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And on the wager lay two earthly women,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Upon your charter and your city’s freedom</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What if my house be troubled with a rat,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And I be pleas’d to give ten thousand ducats</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To have it ban’d? What, are you answer’d yet?</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Some men there are love not a gaping pig;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Some that are mad if they behold a cat;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ th’ nose,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As there is no firm reason to be rend’red</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why he, a harmless necessary cat;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Must yield to such inevitable shame</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">As to offend, himself being offended;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">More than a lodg’d hate and a certain loathing</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I bear Antonio, that I follow thus</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Bassanio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You may as well go stand upon the beach</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Shylock</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You have among you many a purchas’d slave,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Which, fike your asses and your dogs and mules,</p>

I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we turn’d o’er many books together; he is furnished with my opinion which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to fill up your Grace’s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head.

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And earthly power doth then show likest God’s</p>
